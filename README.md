# Vibe Lab — My Creative Coding Sketchbook

A collection of small front-end experiments and “useless web” projects created with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — a programmer’s sketchbook built through vibe coding.

## About
These projects are made in under 3 hours each using GitHub Copilot and creative coding principles.
They focus on **interaction, animation, and emotion** — not utility.
